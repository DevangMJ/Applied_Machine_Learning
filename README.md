# AMLS_assignment20_21
The project is organised as requested, however the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file could not be uploaded to GitHub because it is too big. This file was from the week 6 Lab on Kernels, for that weeks programming assignment. Each task folder has its respective piece of code and the Dataset folder is empty. 

A1 contains the code for the Gender classification, using both a CNN and SVM. A2 contains code for the emotion recognition using both a CNN and SVM. B1 contains code for the face shape classification. B2 contains the code for the Eye colour recognition. 

The required libraries are as follows: os, shutil, random, tensorflow, math, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, cv2, dlib, IPython, PIL, skimage, keras and tqdm.
